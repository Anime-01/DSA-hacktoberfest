<h2> BINARYSUB </h2><hr><div><p>Chef has a binary string SS. He can replace any occurrence of -
<ul>
<li>0101 with aa</li>
<li>1010 with bb</li>
<li>010010 with abab</li>
<li>101101 with baba</li>
</p>
<p>While doing these operations, Chef noticed that he can end up with different strings depending upon the order of application of the operations. Given the final string containing only aa and bb, Chef wants to know the number of possible strings he might have began with.</p>
